    "Suppose we are given a nearest neighbor graph (let's ignore, for now, how we can have obtained such a thing without the ability to find nearest neighbors already). By a graph, I simply mean a network -- a set of nodes connected by edges. By a nearest neighbor graph I mean that the graph has been derived from data existing in some sort of space for which we have a quantitative notion of similarity, or dissimilarity, or distance. In particular the graph is derived by making each data point a node and connecting that data point, via edges, to the $k$ most similar, least dissimilar, or closest other points. We would like to use this graph as an index structure for searching to find the nearest neighbors (points in the graph) of a new query point (potentially not a point in the graph) with respect to that notion of similarity of distance. How can we do this? We can do it via a kind of pruned breadth-first search of the graph, always keeping only the $k$ best points we've found so far. The algorithm, therefore, looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a starting node in the graph (potentially randomly) as a candidate node\n",
    "2. Look at all nodes connected by an edge to the best untried candidate node in the graph\n",
    "3. Add all these nodes to our potential candidate pool\n",
    "4. Sort the candidate pool by closeness / similarity to the query point\n",
    "5. Truncate the pool to $k$ best (as in closest to the query) candidates\n",
    "6. Return to step 2, unless we have already tried all the candidates in the pool\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this play out visually on a small graph. For this case we will let $k=2$ and have a 2-neighbor graph constructed by points in a plane. The query point will be drawn as an orange 'x'. We then search, exactly as described, and find ourselves steadily traversing the graph towards the query point."

We could use that graph as our search index -- it won't be great, and our search will be particularly approximate and often get stuck in local minima because of that, but it will still work a lot of the time. So, given that graph we could do a nearest neighbor search, using that graph as the index, for each and every point in the dataset. Because of the nature of the search we could end up finding new neighbors for a node that are closer than the ones in our not-so-good graph. We could use that information to update our graph -- make it better by using these newly found closer neighbors. Having improved the graph, we can run the search again for each and every point in the dataset. Since the graph is better we will do an even better job of finding neighbors than before and potentially find some new neighbors that will let us update the graph again.\n",

Instead we could run the search just far enough to potentially find some new neighbors that we haven't seen before.

The second round, however, will step out to neighbors of neighbors (friends of friends if you will), and potentially find some nodes that are closer neighbors than the ones currently in the graph.

    "\n",
    "This provides us with the basic algorithm, which is already surprisingly efficient and, importantly, doesn't rely on specific properties of the dissimilarity (such as requiring the triangle inequality) beyond the requirement that \"friends of friends\" should be a good source of candidate neighbors. There are a number of computational considerations that can dramatically improve practical runtime performance however. Let's look at a few of the major ones, particularly since they involve looking at the algorithm in a different way and result in code that looks very dissimilar from what has been described so far, despite the fact that this is essentially what it is implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major consideration is that the search should take place on an undirected \n",
    "graph. That means that when looking at neighbors of a node we need to consider not \n",
    "only the $k$ neighbors that the node has edges to, but also all the other nodes that \n",
    "have our chosen node as one of their $k$ neighbors, often called the \"reverse nearest\n",
    "neighbors\". While it is easy to keep track of the top $k$ neighbors for each node, it is much harder to keep track of the reverse nearest neighbors for each node, and updating that information as the graph changes becomes challenging. For this reason (among others) it becomes beneficial to compute the combined set of neighbors and reverse nearest neighbors for each node based on the graph once at the start of an iteration and use that information while updating the graph in the background. In a sense we are holding the search graph fixed for the iteration, and then applying all the updates at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major consideration is a useful inversion of how we look at the problem. Ultimately for each node we need to look at the neighbors of its neighbors, which involves two hops through the graph. From the point of view of the green node we might view it as looking something like this:\n",

    "<div align=\"middle\"><img src=\"neighbor_of_neighbor.png\" alt=\"Query, to neighbor, to candidate\" width=400px /></div>\n",

    "Since all our work will be on length two paths like this however, we can potentially \n",
    "flip our point of view around and center ourselves at the blue node. From the blue node's point of view the goal here is have the red and the green node consider adding each other to each others $k$ nearest neighbor lists. This flipped viewpoint saves us from some doubled work (we just need to get green and red to talk to each other at once, rather than traversing the path once from green, and then much later the other way from red), but it also turns what was a graph walking algorithm into one that is entirely local to each node: having found the sets of neighbors and reverse neighbors for every node as described above, we simply need to do an all-pairs comparison between the nodes of each such set, having each possible pairing act as the red and green nodes attached to a common node:\n",

    "<div align=\"middle\"><img src=\"common_neighbors.png\" alt=\"Neighbors of a common node\" width=400px /></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these two considerations together we arrive at an approach that first \n",
    "generates a set of \"neighbors\" (both neighbors and reverse neighbors) for each node, then generates graph updates by doing an all-pairs distance computation on each set. After the first step of computing the reverse neighbors the all-pairs computations can all run independently in parallel, saving off the updates from each neighbor set which can then be sorted and applied to update the graph. While this is executing the same notional algorithm, viewing it this way allows for easy parallelism options, and for further efficiency tweaks: keep track of which \"neighbors\" are new to a set and only worry about distance computations to nodes new to the set; restrict the number of elements in the set for any iteration; exit early when the number of updates falls below a (proportional) threshold; etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we arrive at a parallelizable algorithm that can compute an approximate $k$-neighbor graph of a dataset extremely efficiently. Better still it does this, much as our search algorithm did, with few constraints: we require a dissimilarity that has a \"friend-of-a-friend\" principle, and that the *intrinsic* dimension (as opposed to the apparent or ambient dimension) of the dataset is not too large. Is there any way we can speed this up at all?"
